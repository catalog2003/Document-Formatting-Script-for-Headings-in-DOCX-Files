# Document-Formatting-Script-for-Headings-in-DOCX-Files
This Python script utilizes the docx library to process a DOCX file, specifically targeting paragraphs that resemble chapter headings and numbered patterns. The script employs regular expressions to identify different patterns in the text, such as chapters and numbered sections. 
y with the name you gave to your Python script file.

Check the Output:
After running the script, check the specified output file path (output_file_path) for the modified document. The headings in the output document should now have different font sizes based on the patterns identified by the script.

Adjustments (if needed):
If the script doesn't produce the desired results or if your document structure differs, you may need to adjust the regular expressions or the formatting logic in the process_paragraph and replace_with_formatted_run functions. Review the patterns and formatting options to suit your specific requirements.
